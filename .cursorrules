# Cursor Rules

# Repository-wide guidance for this Laravel + Blade + Filament project

# General
# - Framework: Laravel (PHP >= 8.2), View layer: Blade only (no API layer).
# - UI: Filament for admin/UI scaffolding; Tailwind for styling via Vite.
# - Keep controllers thin; move business logic to services in app/Services.
# - Never commit secrets; use .env and .env.example for placeholders only.
# - Prefer explicitness and clarity over cleverness; follow Laravel conventions.
# - Prefer non-interactive commands in docs; ensure commands work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# - All project documentation must live in /docs and be linked from /docs/index.md.
# - When adding a new doc, update /docs/index.md links in alphabetical/logical order.

# Docs: index.md
# - Must link to all available docs in /docs using relative links.
# - Keep links concise; use human-readable titles.
# - Reflect Blade-only architecture (no API link).

# Docs: requirements.md
# - List minimum versions for PHP, Composer, Node, DBs, and PHP extensions.
# - Separate required vs recommended tools; keep versions current.
# - Mention optional Docker and mail testing tools.

# Docs: setup.md
# - Provide a step-by-step setup from clone to serve.
# - Use non-interactive Composer/NPM commands where possible.
# - Include Filament installation steps and Vite build instructions.
# - Reference Blade docs; avoid any API tooling.

# Docs: environment.md
# - Enumerate critical .env keys grouped by concern (app, db, cache/queue, mail, redis).
# - Include environment profiles (local vs production) and debug guidance.
# - Explicitly warn against committing real secrets.

# Docs: database.md
# - Show migration and rollback commands; include seeding instructions.
# - Note seeders should be idempotent and safe in development.
# - Encourage use of factories for test data generation.

# Docs: tests.md
# - Prefer `php artisan test`; optionally show direct phpunit command.
# - Include optional coverage command with Xdebug and a reasonable minimum threshold.
# - State guidelines: isolation, factories, transactions/refresh database.

# Docs: todo.md
# - Use checkbox list format; each item should be action-oriented and clear.
# - Keep items high-level (not overly granular); maintain current project priorities.

# Docs: architecture.md
# - Document MVC layout paths (Models, Controllers, Views) and domain services.
# - Emphasize Blade views and absence of API layer; routes are in routes/web.php only.
# - Encourage thin controllers, rich services; mention jobs, events, listeners structure.

# Docs: laravel-cheatsheet.md
# - Include common queue and schedule commands; useful optimizations and cache clears.
# - Keep concise; avoid duplicating detailed docs found elsewhere.

# Docs: deployment.md
# - Include composer optimize, Laravel caches (config/route/view), and Vite build steps.
# - Use `php artisan migrate --force` and include cron and supervisor notes.
# - Remind about .env correctness and file permissions for storage/ and bootstrap/cache/.

# Docs: security.md
# - State secret handling rules, least-privilege principles, input validation.
# - Provide a private vulnerability reporting process.

# Docs: contributing.md
# - Describe branch strategy (feature branches from main) and PR etiquette.
# - Define commit message style and testing expectations before submit.

# Docs: changelog.md
# - Follow Keep a Changelog style with Unreleased and versioned sections.
# - Summarize Added/Changed/Fixed; avoid noisy entries.

# Docs: blade.md
# - Define views structure (layouts, components, partials) and naming.
# - Encourage using layouts, stacks, components; avoid inline scripts/styles.
# - Default to escaped output; only use `@{!! !!}@` when safe and necessary.

# Docs: ui-filament.md
# - Include installation steps and resource/panel generation commands.
# - Note auth integration and access control configuration in config/filament.php.
# - Mention Tailwind customization and Vite asset build requirements.
